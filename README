!!! NOTES

Fixed compatibility with 2.90.1 (Ubuntu 11.10), but lost a lot of functionality and support for previous versions.

INSTALLATION:
cd ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins
git clone git://github.com/ivalkeen/rhythmbox-vkontakte.git vkontakte

USING:
currently it doesn't play by click in search results, so you can:
1. drag-n-drop tracks to play queue from search results
2. Just click play and use 'next track'/'prev track' and shuffle to play all search results sequentially

======
rhythmbox-vkontakte is a rhythmbox plugin for searching and listening to vkontakte (vk.com) audio records

rhythmbox-youtube (http://gitorious.org/rhythmbox-youtube/rhythmbox-youtube)
has been used as example by developing.

INSTALLATION:
1)
cd ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/ (create if missing)
git clone git://github.com/grunichev/rhythmbox-vkontakte.git vkontakte

2) activate "Vkontakte-Music" plugin

If you're going to download files, set directory (Plugins => Vkontakte-Music => Configure)
By default it's:
~/Music/%A - %T.mp3
where %A is replaced with artist data of downloaded file and %T - with title.
You may use these symbols many times, e.g. for per-artist folders:
~/Music/%A/%T - %A.mp3
