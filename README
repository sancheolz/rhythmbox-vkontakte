ABOUT
======
rhythmbox-vkontakte is a rhythmbox plugin for searching and listening to vkontakte (vk.com) audio records

rhythmbox-vkontakte (http://github.com/grunichev/rhythmbox-vkontakte)
has been used as example by developing.

If you're going to download files, set directory (Plugins => Vkontakte => Configure)
By default it's:
~/Music/%A - %T.mp3
where %A is replaced with artist data of downloaded file and %T - with title.
You may use these symbols many times, e.g. for per-artist folders:
~/Music/%A/%T - %A.mp3
